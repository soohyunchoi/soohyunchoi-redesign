## 🏄‍♂️ Overview
I graduated from UCSB in June of 2023, and decided that I need a better online base of operations than the website I've been using for the past 5+ years. I've been wanting to make something with really satisfying and crispy animations, so I picked up Framer Motion and had a great time learning and implementing it into my portfolio website. Hopefully it's as fun using it (try the carousel) as it was to build it :)

## ✨ Features
- Custom animations built with Framer Motion
- Components designed from the ground-up with TailwindCSS
- Speed with Next.js SSG (96 performance score on [Google Pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-soohyunchoi-com/6c8e77c7vc?form_factor=desktop)

## 🔗 Dependencies
- tailwindcss
- postcss
- autoprefixer
